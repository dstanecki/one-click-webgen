    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 7</h2>
        <p>Ducks are known for their quack, but not all ducks sound the same. Some ducks whistle, some grunt, and some are silent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 8</h2>
        <p>Ducks have been domesticated as pets and farm animals for more than 500 years, and all domestic ducks are descended from either the Mallard or the Muscovy duck.</p>

    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 9</h2>
        <p>Ducks have waterproof feathers due to an intricate feather structure and a waxy coating that is spread on each feather while preening. A duck's feathers are so waterproof that even when the duck dives underwater, its downy underlayer of feathers will stay completely dry.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 10</h2>
        <p>Ducks have highly specialized bills that allow them to forage in mud and silt. The edges of the bill are fringed to strain plants, seeds, and small animals from water, mud, and pebbles.</p>
