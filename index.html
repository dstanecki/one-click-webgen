                <p>Bunnies, or rabbits, have an exceptional sense of vision. They can see nearly 360 degrees around, which helps them spot predators from all directions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rabbits have a unique digestive system. They eat their own poop to get nutrients that they missed during the first passage through the gut, a process known as coprophagy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unlike dogs and cats, rabbits are crepuscular - most active at dawn and dusk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rabbits' teeth never stop growing. They keep them worn down by gnawing on bark and other hard foods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The world's largest rabbit, named Darius, measures over 4 feet long and weighs approximately 50 pounds.</p>
