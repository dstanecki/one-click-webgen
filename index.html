        <h2>Fact 1: Bunnies are not rodents</h2>
        <p>Despite popular belief, rabbits are not rodents. They belong to the family Leporidae and are actually lagomorphs, along with pikas and hares.</p>
        <h2>Fact 2: Bunnies have almost 360-degree vision</h2>
        <p>Rabbits have a nearly 360-degree vision, which allows them to detect predators from all directions. They can see everything behind them and only have a small blind spot in front of their nose.</p>
        <h2>Fact 3: Bunnies can't vomit</h2>
        <p>Unlike cats and dogs, rabbits can't vomit. This is why it's crucial for them to have a diet that's high in fiber to keep their digestive system moving smoothly.</p>
