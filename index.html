    <h1>Compare Actions, Bamboo, and Jenkins</h1>
    <p>Actions, Bamboo, and Jenkins are all popular tools used in software development for continuous integration and continuous delivery. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific needs of the project.</p>
    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>Actions is a tool developed by GitHub. It is deeply integrated with the GitHub ecosystem, making it a convenient choice for projects hosted on GitHub. However, it may not be the best choice for projects hosted elsewhere.</p>
    <h2>Bamboo</h2>
    <p>Bamboo is a tool developed by Atlassian. It is well-suited to large, complex projects, especially those using other Atlassian tools like Jira and Bitbucket. However, it may be overkill for smaller, simpler projects.</p>
    <h2>Jenkins</h2>
    <p>Jenkins is an open-source tool that is highly customizable and has a large community of users. It is a good choice for projects that need a high degree of customization. However, it can be difficult to set up and maintain.</p>
