        <h2>Fact 1</h2>
        <p>Bunnies are crepuscular, which means they are most active during dawn and dusk. This is a natural instinct to avoid predators who hunt during the day and night.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 2</h2>
        <p>Rabbits have an excellent sense of smell, hearing and vision. They have nearly 360° panoramic vision, allowing them to detect predators from all directions. They can see everything behind them and only have a small blind spot in front of their nose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 3</h2>
        <p>Rabbits are social animals that live in medium-sized groups known as colonies. The wild European rabbit lives in intricate burrow systems, called warrens, for protection against predators.</p>

        <h2>Fact 4</h2>
        <p>Rabbits' teeth never stop growing. They keep them worn down by gnawing on bark and other hard foods. In nature, rabbits would eat a variety of foods that would help grind down their teeth and keep their growth in check.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact 5</h2>
        <p>Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a 'binky', when they're happy — performing twists and kicks in mid-air!</p>
